One of the most disgusting slanders by the right against low-income people and especially African Americans is the claim that the subprime collapse resulted from the government pressuring lenders to loan to unqualified borrowers. The vast majority of subprime loans were written by mortgage companies not even covered by federal law. Subprime was a scheme originated on Wall Street to profit from deceiving borrowers.", "date": "2014-05-26"}

It was at once a hate crime, an act of terror and another tragic example of our lack of common sense gun control. Before the victims' bodies were even identified, Donald Trump was trying to fear-bait and scapegoat, bragging that he'd somehow been proven right and doubling down on his plan to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. But Trump's disgusting attempt to capitalize on a national tragedy didn't work. According to a CBS poll, only 25 percent approved of his shameful response, while 51 percent disapproved, and nearly two-thirds rejected his Muslim ban. Meanwhile, several members of Congress walked out of the now-traditional post-massacre moment of silence, with Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) calling them \"an abomination\" that does not \"honor the victims\" but \"mocks them.\" Senate Democrats then took over the Senate for 15 hours demanding action on gun control. Whatever the outcome, it is heartening to know that the time of silence is finally over, and that voices for reform are being heard over racist, divisive dog-whistles.", "date": "2016-06-19"}
