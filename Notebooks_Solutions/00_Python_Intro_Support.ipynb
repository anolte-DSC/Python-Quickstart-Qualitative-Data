    "This notebook provides an overview of tools, techniques, and resources that can support you while writing Python code. There are built-in features within Python and IPython environments, as well as a wide range of external resources that enhance productivity, learning, and problem-solving. \n",
    "\n",
    "When working with Python, it's important to consider your coding environment — whether it's Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Spyder, or a terminal on a computing cluster — as each offers unique strengths and levels of interactivity. Knowing your options helps you select the setup and support tools that best match your coding needs and goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. How to work with Python environments\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Overview of common environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Each environment also shapes how you learn and apply Python in practice: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter** focuses on interactive, cell-based execution — ideal for experimenting and visualizing code step by step. It also supports Markdown, making it excellent for documentation, which is especially important for **sharing code and teaching**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spyder** mimics a MATLAB-style Integrated Development Environment (IDE), offering script-based coding and a built-in console (also similar to RStudio). \n",
    "\n",
    "**VS Code** supports both script-based coding and interactive cells. It also includes powerful IDE features such as integrated terminals, debugging tools, and in-line LLM assistance for completing functions or explaining code snippets as you type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both Spyder and VS Code include variable explorers (tables showing variable names, types, and values), which make it easy to inspect variables at a glance and explore data interactively through a graphical interface. These environments are excellent choices for **developing scripts and performing data analysis**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Running Python from the **terminal** is also common and often essential when executing existing scripts on systems like **high-performance computing clusters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, Python code and libraries are compatible across all environments. While executing notebook code (`.ipynb`) outside of Jupyter typically requires a conversion to a `.py` script, you don’t have to commit to just one environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 How to use these environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using any of the environments mentioned above (Jupyter, Spyder, VS Code, terminal), **Python must be installed** on the system (it's also installed in the background of JupyterHubs). Once Python is installed, each environment can be added as an additional tool — some through package managers, others via standalone installers or distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/)\n",
    "- Alternatively, install the Anaconda Distribution, which comes with Python, Jupyter, Spyder, and many scientific libraries preinstalled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing & Running Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "The following instructions mainly refer to Windows or macOS systems. Linux users may install these tools via system package managers or use terminal-based workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Environment | Installation Method | How to Run? / Notes |\n",
    "|-------------|----------------------|-------|\n",
    "| **Jupyter Notebook** | `pip install notebook` or `conda install notebook` | Use `jupyter notebook` (in terminal) to launch |\n",
    "| **JupyterLab** | `pip install jupyterlab` or `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab` | More modern version of Jupyter Notebook |\n",
    "| **Spyder** | `pip install spyder` or `conda install spyder` | Best used via Anaconda; Use `spyder` (in terminal) to launch or click the Spyder desktop icon  |\n",
    "| **VS Code** | Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) | Install the Python extension after launching: VS Code connects to your Python installation via the Python extension; click the VS Code desktop icon to run |\n",
    "| **Terminal** | Comes with your operating system | Use to run `.py` scripts directly (e.g. `python myscript.py`) |\n",
    "\n",
