    "- Functions are specialized tools - each one does a specific job, like a hammer, a saw, or a measuring tape.\n",

Each **object** you create from the class is like building a specific toolbox based on that blueprint.\n",
    "- Libraries are like borrowing tools and toolboxes from a neighbor – someone already built helpful tools you can use right away."

    "Classes help keep data and the functions that operate on it bundled together, making your code more organized and easier to manage. That said, in many common Python tasks - like visualizing data, using existing machine learning models, or working with data in pandas - you can do everything you need without writing your own classes. If you're mainly applying existing tools and libraries, classes might not be necessary. However, as your projects grow or become more complex - for example, if you're building your own models, creating reusable tools, or working on larger codebases - classes can help you write cleaner, more maintainable code.
