# Python-Quickstart-Qualitative-Data

This repository contains materials for the workshop "Python Quickstart for Qualitative Data" hosted by the Data Science Center (DSC) at the University of Bremen. The materials were developed by Annika Nolte and Nele Fuchs.

The materials contain:

- /Notebooks_Exercises (Jupyter notebooks including unsolved exercises)
- /Notebooks_Solutions (Jupyter notebooks including exercises with solutions)
- /Images (images loaded in the Jupyter notebooks)
- /Data (datasets loaded in the Jupyter notebooks)
- Data_References.txt (provides references for the datasets included in the /Data folder)

Note that the provided notebooks were created with greatest care, but no guarantee can be given for the correctness of the analyses.
